### sidenotes

> Further Suggestions:
> API Documentation: Clearly document each API endpoint, detailing its purpose, input requirements, and output format.

> Error Handling: Implement robust error handling for each API to manage and respond to different error conditions gracefully.

> Security Measures: Apply appropriate authentication and authorization checks to ensure that only authorized users can access or modify data.

> Performance Optimization: Especially for the Export API, consider performance aspects like efficient data retrieval and handling large datasets.
